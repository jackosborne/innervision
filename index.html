						The Key to creating a Successful F&B Venue is not just about
						having great food and drink. With so many choices, the decision of
						where to Dine out often comes down to the Atmosphere and Ambiance.
						but it is not just those that create a First Class Restaurant. One
						needs to meet the needs of the Client and often is down to Detail
						and Food Service that is remembered.
					</p>
					<p>
						InnerVision Design brings a fresh, energetic, visionary approach
						to Restaurant and Bar Design, crafting luxury experiences. Not
						just Interior Design, but also covering a wide range of other
						services giving our expertise to the whole project which can make
						a difference from other Interior Design and Management Practices.

					<h2>Interior Design</h2>
					<p>
						One of the Fundamental elements required in Hospitality Design is
						Atmosphere and Ambiance making all the difference to selling the
						product and getting the customers in the door. But the Interior
						Design has the responsibility of creating the mood of the space
						which determines and improves the experience.

					<h2>Space Planning</h2>
					<p>
						Good Space Planning and clever use of Scale allows the guest to feel
						comfortable with the space allowing them not to feel that they can
						dine in comfort. Good circulation and flow through the space also
						assists the staff providing Table Service from bumping into each
						other or guests moving about the restaurant when it comes down to
						Buffet Service.

							need to bring their IPhone out to light up the menu to read them.
							The correct principle of good lighting is fundamental

						<h2>Kitchen to Table</h2>
						<p>
							Understanding how food is presented and served to the customer can also make a big
							difference to
							how the guest feels that they have been treated with care and consideration. The last thing
							one
							wants to see is the customer feeling that they did not get provided with Service if they are
							being charged money or something that is not good. Staff and how the table is set up plays a
							vital part of the guest experience. When good, the customer will say and recommend. When bad
							they simply will not come back and that is the last thing you want.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many different levels of Table Set UP. From fine dining with all the appropriate
							Glass
							wear / Stem wear, Flat wear, Cutlery to be presented at each course or just a simple basic
							table
							setting.
						</p>
						<p>
							If one was lucky to be invited to Buckingham Palace for a State Dinner one would see that
							every
							alignment of Plate / Glass / Fork and Spoon have been carefully measured by rulers to ensure
							that each place setting is the same as the person adjacent to you. I am not saying that for
							Hospitality one has to go to these measures but with experience guidance from InnerVision
							Design
							it can make all the first impressions the difference. “The Devil is in the detail”

						<h2>Display Kitchens</h2>

						</p>
						<p>
							Establishing what you want the customer to see from a Display Kitchen needs to be
							thought out before you can start planning a Kitchen. types of food that will be prepared and
							served
							from an open space. Number of chef’s working there also needs to be considered as the last
							thing
							you want to see is them all falling over themselves in a badly designed Kitchen.
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing and fully understanding how a Buffet Counter should work is also a very
							specialist subject. As some of the Display Kitchens are providing freshly cooked food or
							replenishing food to a Buffet Counter line.
						</p>
						<p>
							First impressions on presentation of the Food is extremely important as this provides
							the customer with an insight of what they can select to eat. The need for the right Kitchen
							Equipment fitted in the Interior Designer’s Counters also plays a vital part of the
							Buffet Set Up. Only through experience of what both parties need can make the whole Buffet
							flow
							with ease.
